üîê Web Security Academy Progress

I am actively learning web application security through PortSwigger's Web Security Academy, focusing on identifying, understanding, and exploiting real-world vulnerabilities. This hands-on learning path is enhancing my practical cybersecurity skills and deepening my understanding of secure software development.

Key Areas of Study:

    Server-Side Vulnerabilities: SQL Injection (SQLi), SSRF, authentication flaws, and business logic vulnerabilities.
    Client-Side Vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF, and browser-based attacks.
    Authentication & Access Control: Session management, broken access control, and privilege escalation.
    Advanced Exploitation Techniques: Exploiting complex security flaws and bypassing security mechanisms.

Current Focus:

    Completing practical labs to apply offensive security techniques.
    Gaining expertise in detecting and mitigating web vulnerabilities.
    Integrating security best practices into software development workflows.

This repository will document my progress, insights, and solutions from labs to showcase my growing expertise in web security.
